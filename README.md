# Sales Analysis With PowerBI

## Project Overview

The purpose of this data analysis project is to shed light on a store's sales performance from 2010 to 2017. Through an analysis of several sales data points, I hope to spot patterns and develop a better grasp of the company's performance. This was my very first try at PowerBI.  

## Data Overview

### This dataset contains the sales of products from the year 2010- 2017 in various contries around the world. The dataset is made of 11 columns, which inncludes:

 1. **Region:** This column contains a list of all the regions where items were ordered from.
 2. **Country:** This is a column that houses the countries where sales were made.
 3. **Item Type:** This contains the type of item that each customers ordered.
 4. **Sales Channel:** This indicates wether the order was made Offline or Online.
 5. **Order Priority:** This columns indicates what the order priority was.
 6. **Order Date:** This shows the date when the order was made.
 7. **Order ID:** There is always a unique Id for every order, so that is what this column contains. 
 8. **Ship Date:** The date when the item goes out for delivering is what this column indicates.
 9. **Units Sold:** The quantity of the goods sold in a particular region.
 10. **Unit Price:** Unit price is the price for each unit of what they are getting.
 11. **Unit Cost:** A unit cost is the total expenditure incurred by the store to store, and sell one unit of a particular product.
