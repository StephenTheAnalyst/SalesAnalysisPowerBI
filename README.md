# Sales Analysis With PowerBI

## Project Overview

The purpose of this data analysis project is to shed light on a store's sales performance from 2010 to 2017. Through an analysis of several sales data points, I hope to spot patterns and develop a better grasp of the company's performance. This was my very first try at PowerBI.  

## Data Overview

### This dataset contains the sales of products from the year 2010- 2017 in various contries around the world. The dataset is made of 11 columns, which inncludes:

 1. **Region:** This column contains a list of all the regions where items were ordered from.
 2. **Country:** This is a column that houses the countries where sales were made.
 3. **Item Type:** This contains the type of item that each customers ordered.
 4. **Sales Channel:** This indicates wether the order was made Offline or Online.
 5. **Order Priority:** This columns indicates what the order priority was.
 6. **Order Date:** This shows the date when the order was made.
 7. **Order ID:** There is always a unique Id for every order, so that is what this column contains. 
 8. **Ship Date:** The date when the item goes out for delivering is what this column indicates.
 9. **Units Sold:** The quantity of the goods sold in a particular region.
 10. **Unit Price:** Unit price is the price for each unit of what they are getting.
 11. **Unit Cost:** A unit cost is the total expenditure incurred by the store to store, and sell one unit of a particular product.

## Tools
- PowerBi (Visualization and Analysis)
- Excel (for data modelling)

## Data Cleaning/Preparation

- Data Modelling
- Removing Duplicates
- Created Calender Table
- Created Measures

## Exploratory Data Analysis

Here are some exploring i did with the dataset:

 1. Trend on total Sales and Profit by Quarters and months?
 2. Trend on how each item types were sold over the years
 3. Top 10 countries by sales
 4. How well did the store perform in the year 2017
 5. Which channel profits the most

 ### Online Performance

**_ From the above charts, it is obvious both channels are arguably on the same level of profitablity. But we can tell from the chart countries were each channels are most used from the "top 10 countries by sales" chart._**

## Conclusion
 - Household is the overall most sold itemtype
 -  Taiwan brought the most sales overall
 -  Total Sales was $13.3bn
 -  Total Profit was $3.95bn
